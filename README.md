# Analysing Energy Outcomes Based on Countries' Development Levels (2010-2020) with Visual Analytics Approach

A comprehensive visual analytics project exploring energy-related outcomes based on countries' development levels. This project combines statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictions to assess trends in accessibility, efficiency, renewable energy, and emissions over the past decade.

## Project Overview
This project was conducted as part of the **Master's in Data Science** program at **City, University of London (2024)**, where it was received a grade of **82** and is considered **publishable**. It demonstrated advanced skills in data analysis, clustering, and visual analytics.

## Key Components
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating patterns in energy accessibility, efficiency, and emissions across countries.
- **Clustering & Segmentation**: Grouping countries by development levels and analyzing energy outcomes within these clusters.
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualizations**: Applying statistical models and creating visualizations to uncover trends and disparities.
- **Forecasting & Predictions**: Using historical data to predict energy trends for 2030 and compare them to UN sustainable development goals.

## Goals
- Analyze energy outcomes in relation to countries' development levels from 2010-2020.
- Investigate accessibility, efficiency, renewable energy, and emissions trends.
- Provide actionable insights and predictions regarding the achievement of the UN's sustainable development goals by 2030.

## Key Findings
- **Significant Variations**: Energy outcomes vary widely across countries, with developed nations showing better performance in all aspects.
- **Positive Trends**: Notable improvements in energy accessibility and energy efficiency, with narrowing urban-rural gaps in energy access.
- **Concerns & Gaps**: Despite positive trends, gaps remain in achieving the UN's 2030 energy goals, particularly in emissions reduction.
- **Predictions for 2030**: Projections suggest a potential shortfall in meeting sustainable development targets without further intervention.

## Data Attribution
The data used in this project is sourced from the [World Bank database](https://data.worldbank.org/), which supplies two sets of data:
1. **Countriesâ€™ Development Levels (2015)**: This dataset provides insights into the development status of countries, categorizing them into different groups based on their development indicators.
2. **Energy-Related Indicators (2010-2020)**: This dataset includes energy performance indicators for countries over the period 2010-2020, covering aspects like energy access, efficiency, renewable energy, and emissions.

These datasets enable a detailed analysis of the relationship between a country's development level and its performance across various energy-related aspects.
