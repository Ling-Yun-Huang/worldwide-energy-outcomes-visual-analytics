# ⚡ Energy Outcomes vs Countries' Development Levels (2010-2020) 🌍

A visual analytics project exploring energy accessibility, efficiency, renewable energy, and emissions across countries. Combines EDA, clustering, statistical analysis, and forecasting. 📊💡

## 🚀 Original Project (2024)  
**Scope**: Analysing Energy Outcomes Based on Countries' Development Levels (2010-2020) with Visual Analytics Approach  

This project was conducted as part of the **Master's in Data Science** program at **City, University of London (2024)**, receiving a grade of **82** and considered **publishable**. It demonstrated advanced skills in data analysis, clustering, and visual analytics.  

**Methods**: K-means clustering, visual analytics, mixed model  

**Insights**:  
- **Significant variations**: Developed countries outperform in accessibility, efficiency, and emissions.  
- **Positive trends**: Energy access and efficiency improving, urban-rural gaps narrowing.  
- **Forecasts**: Gaps remain to meet UN 2030 energy goals 🔮

## 🆕 Methodological Extension (2025)
- **Objective**: Compare clustering methods for grouping countries by development level  
- **Methods Compared**: K-means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model  
- **Validation Metrics**: Silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin  
- **Key Findings**:
  - K-means with **5 clusters** is most balanced and interpretable.  
  - Agglomerative clustering is less stable; GMM captured soft clusters but slightly lower scores.  
  - Comparative plots highlight differences in cluster structure. 📈
