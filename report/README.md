This study examines energy outcomes across countries based on development levels (2010–2020).  
Countries were clustered into five groups using K-Means. Key findings are:

- Group 0: High GDP, excellent energy access and efficiency.
- Group 1: Strong economy and energy access, weaker efficiency and renewable adoption.
- Group 2: Low energy access, especially rural; high renewable energy share.
- Group 3: Large population countries; mixed performance with rising CO2.
- Group 4: Small or low-population nations; moderate performance.

Trends (2010–2020) show improved accessibility and efficiency in most groups, narrowed urban-rural gaps, but CO2 emissions remain concerning.  
Predictions for 2030 indicate partial progress toward UN goals.
