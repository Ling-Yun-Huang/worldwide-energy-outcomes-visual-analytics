### [📄 Original Project (2024)](Visual%20Analytics%20Coursework_LYHuang.pdf)

This study examines energy outcomes across countries based on development levels (2010–2020).  
Countries were clustered into five groups using K-Means. Key findings are:

- 🌍 Group 0: High GDP, excellent energy access ⚡ and efficiency ⚙️.
- 💰 Group 1: Strong economy 💵 and energy access ⚡, weaker efficiency ⚙️ and renewable adoption ♻️.
- 🚜 Group 2: Low energy access ⚡ (especially rural 🏡); high renewable energy share ♻️.
- 👥 Group 3: Large population countries 🌏; mixed performance with rising CO2 emissions 🌫️.
- 🏝️ Group 4: Small or low-population nations; moderate performance 📊.

Trends (2010–2020) show improved accessibility ⚡ and efficiency ⚙️ in most groups, narrowed urban-rural gaps 🏙️🏡, but CO2 emissions 🌫️ remain concerning.  
Predictions for 2030 indicate partial progress toward UN goals 🎯.

### [⚖️ Clustering Comparison Extension (2025)](Clustering_comparison_results.md)

Comparison of three different clustering methods, evaluating with metrics:

- 🔹 Methods Compared: K-means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model
- 📏 Validation Metrics: Silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin
- 📝 Key Findings:
  - ✅ K-means with 5 clusters is most balanced and interpretable.
  - ⚠️ Agglomerative clustering is less stable; GMM captured soft clusters but slightly lower scores.
  - 📈 Comparative plots highlight differences in cluster structure.
