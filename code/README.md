# **Code Overview**

This folder includes two Jupyter notebooks that analyze global development and energy access trends.

## **1. Exploratory Data Analysis & Countries Development Clustering**
- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizes key development-related and energy-related variables
- Applies k-means clustering techniques to group countries based on their development patterns

## **2. Energy Analysis**
- Analyzes historical energy access trends
- Uses statistical and machine learning models to forecast energy access rates until 2030
- Implements Mixed Effects Models to account for grouped country-level variations

## ðŸ“Š **Visualization Notes**
- Some figures in the notebooks are generated using **Altair**. Since Altair creates interactive visualizations that rely on Vega-Lite, the figures are **not stored as static images**.
- To ensure the figures are displayed correctly, they are **saved separately and loaded using `display()`** in the notebook.
